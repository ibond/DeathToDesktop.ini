DeathToDesktop.ini
==================

Keep your desktop clean when showing protected operating system files by automatically deleting desktop.ini from your Desktop directory whenever it is created.

The program will monitor your user's Desktop directory and the shared Desktop directory.  If a file named desktop.ini is created in either location it will be automatically deleted.

The "package" directory contains the latest builds.  If you don't care about the source just use the executable in package/Release.

Use --install or --uninstall to make this run on startup.
